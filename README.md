# progetto_radon

This is the repository of "Progetto Radon", a project carried out by Speleo Club Erba, in collaboration with an high school of Erba (CO), Italy, for the measurement of concentrations of radon in some caves of Triangolo Lariano, and the dependence of this concentrations from other proxy variables suche as lithotype, depth, presence/absence of water.
Unfortunately, due to the deadlines given by Italian Alpine Club, it has not been possible to monitor concentration for a year, as is usually done, but only a simultaneous single measurement in 3 different caves: doing so we tried to remove temporal variability and maintain only the spatial one.
